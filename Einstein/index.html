                        <article>Albert Einstein, born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, is widely regarded as
                            one of the most influential physicists in history. His groundbreaking
                            work fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe. He is
                            best known for his theory of relativity, particularly the equation E =
                            mc², which revealed the relationship between mass and energy and
                            revolutionized physics.</article>
                        <article>Einstein's early life was marked by a deep curiosity about nature and
                            a passion for science. He studied at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in
                            Zurich and initially struggled to find academic employment, working
                            as a patent clerk in Switzerland. During this time, he produced four
                            revolutionary papers in 1905, a year often referred to as his “Annus
                            Mirabilis” or miracle year.</article>
                        <article>Einstein was also a strong advocate for pacifism, civil rights, and
                            nuclear disarmament, though he played an indirect role in the
                            development of the atomic bomb by urging the U.S. government to
                            begin nuclear research before Nazi Germany could. He passed away
                            in 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape modern
                            science and thought.</article>

                        <p>
                            Einstein introduces special relativity, asserting that the laws of physics are the same for all observers. He presents the famous equation E=mc2
                             , linking mass and energy. This paper revolutionizes the understanding of space and time and serves as a cornerstone of modern physics.

                        <p>In this brief paper, Einstein argues that a body’s inertia is directly related to its energy content. This work elaborates on the mass-energy equivalence and hints at future implications for nuclear physics, impacting our understanding of fundamental principles in physics.</p>

                        <p>In this publication, Einstein explores the interaction between light and matter, proposing the concept of stimulated emission. His work bridges classical physics and quantum theory, laying the groundwork for technologies like lasers and influencing the development of quantum mechanics.</p>

                        <p>Einstein applies his general relativity to cosmology, introducing the cosmological constant for a static universe. Although he later dismissed it, the concept has gained relevance in discussions of dark energy and the universe's fate, influencing modern cosmology significantly.</p>

                        <p>Einstein proposes a dual nature of light, suggesting that it behaves both as a wave and as a particle (photon). This paper lays the groundwork for quantum theory by introducing the concept of quantized energy levels in light. His insights significantly impact the field of quantum mechanics and the understanding of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
